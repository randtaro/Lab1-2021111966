I have a family. There are three people in my family. They are father, mother and me. My father is a teacher in the university.He likes doing sports. He swims every evening. He is tall and thin.He is sweeping the floor now. My mother is a teacher, too. She likes doing housework. She cooks everyday. She is not fat and not short. She is walking now.
I am a student. I like reading books in my bedroom.I take a bus at seven. I am short and thin. I am writing now.I love my family.
